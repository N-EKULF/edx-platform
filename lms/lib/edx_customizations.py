"""
Edx customizations for the LMS.

Note: In order to enable rollout of new mappings from request path to
  NewRelic app name suffix via config, this module may contain multiple
  implementations (the current and the last).  This enables quick rollback
  via config.

TODO:
1. Move this file out of edx-platform and into a plugin.
2. The following may move into an ADR at that time.

Decisions:

* Weâ€™ll start with a team-based split of the LMS at first, rather than domain based.
  * We can always change it to a different orientation if that has issues.
* All new apps should have apdex and error alerting routed to a team.

Goals:

* Enables simpler alerting and on-call configuration for team ownership inside edx-platform.
* All parts of edx-platform should be owned and nothing should end up in the default app.
